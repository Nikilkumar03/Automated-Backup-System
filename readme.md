# Backup Automation System (Bash Project)
 
## Project Overview
This project is a **fully automated backup system** written in **Bash**, designed to create, verify, and clean up backups efficiently.  
It’s ideal for developers and system administrators who want a simple, configurable, and reliable backup workflow.
 
### Features
 Create compressed `.tar.gz` backups with date and time  
 Automatically generate and verify SHA-256 checksums  
 Clean up old backups using retention rules (daily/weekly/monthly)  
 Configurable backup settings via `backup.config`  
 Logging of all actions with timestamps  
 Dry run mode (test what will happen without executing)  
 Prevents multiple runs using a lock file  
 Optional restore functionality

## Configuration (`backup.config`)
 
The script reads this configuration file to set up your backup preferences.
 
```bash
# --- Default Backup Configuration ---
 
# Where to store backups
BACKUP_DESTINATION=./backups
 
# Patterns to exclude from backup (comma-separated)
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS=".git,node_modules,.cache"
 
# Retention rules
DAILY_KEEP=7
WEEKLY_KEEP=4
MONTHLY_KEEP=3
 
# (Optional) Email notifications (not implemented yet)
EMAIL_NOTIFICATION=""
 
 
Step 1: Make the script executable
chmod +x backup.sh
 
Step 2: Run a normal backup
./backup.sh ./test_data
 
 
This creates a backup file like:
 
backup-2025-11-03-1630.tar.gz
backup-2025-11-03-1630.tar.gz.sha256
 
Step 3: Run in dry-run mode
 
See what would happen without actually creating/deleting files.
 
./backup.sh --dry-run ./test_data
 
Step 4: Restore from a backup (optional bonus)
./backup.sh --restore backups/daily/backup-2025-11-03-1630.tar.gz --to ./restored_files
 
 ## How It Works
 
 Step 1: Create Backup
 
The script compresses the target folder into a .tar.gz file.
 
# It names the backup using the current date and time:
 
backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.tar.gz
 
 Step 2: Generate and Verify Checksum
 
# It creates a SHA-256 checksum for each backup:
 
sha256sum backup.tar.gz > backup.tar.gz.sha256
 
 
# Then it verifies the integrity of the archive immediately:
 
sha256sum -c backup.tar.gz.sha256
